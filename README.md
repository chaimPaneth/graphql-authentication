# GraphQL Authentication

A very opinionated user authentication package for [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/). It uses old-school email/password authentication.

This package does not access your data layer (e.g. an ORM); for that you need to write a _adapter_ (which is not hard to do).
If you use Prisma, there is already an adapter for you, **[graphql-authentication-prisma](https://github.com/Volst/graphql-authentication/tree/master/packages/graphql-authentication-prisma)**.
